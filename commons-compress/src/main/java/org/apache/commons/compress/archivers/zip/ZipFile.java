/**
 * Replacement for <code>java.util.ZipFile</code>.
 *
 * <p>This class adds support for file name encodings other than UTF-8
 * (which is required to work on ZIP files created by native zip tools
 * and is able to skip a preamble like the one found in self
 * extracting archives.  Furthermore it returns instances of
 * <code>org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveEntry</code>
 * instead of <code>java.util.zip.ZipEntry</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>It doesn't extend <code>java.util.zip.ZipFile</code> as it would
 * have to reimplement all methods anyway.  Like
 * <code>java.util.ZipFile</code>, it uses RandomAccessFile under the
 * covers and supports compressed and uncompressed entries.  As of
 * Apache Commons Compress 1.3 it also transparently supports Zip64
 * extensions and thus individual entries and archives larger than 4
 * GB or with more than 65536 entries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The method signatures mimic the ones of
 * <code>java.util.zip.ZipFile</code>, with a couple of exceptions:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>There is no getName method.</li>
 *   <li>entries has been renamed to getEntries.</li>
 *   <li>getEntries and getEntry return
 *   <code>org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveEntry</code>
 *   instances.</li>
 *   <li>close is allowed to throw IOException.</li>
 * </ul>
